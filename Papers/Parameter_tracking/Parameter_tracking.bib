  abstract = {This paper focuses on high-frequency (gamma band) EEG activity, the
	most characteristic electrophysiological pattern in focal
	
	seizures of human epilepsy. It starts with recent hypotheses about:
	(i) the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal or
	
	neocortical networks in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations;
	(ii) the nonuniform alteration of GABAergic inhibition in
	
	experimental epilepsy (reduced dendritic inhibition and increased
	somatic inhibition); and (iii) the possible depression of
	
	GABAA,fast circuit activity by GABAA,slow inhibitory postsynaptic
	currents. In particular, these hypotheses are introduced in a new
	
	computational macroscopic model of EEG activity that includes a physiologically
	relevant fast inhibitory feedback loop. Results
	
	show that strikingly realistic activity is produced by the model when
	compared to real EEG signals recorded with intracerebral
	
	electrodes. They show that, in the model, the transition from interictal
	to fast ictal activity is explained by the impairment of
	
	dendritic inhibition.},

	epielptic activity can be modeled by changing inhibitory parameters.
	In particular it is shown that a decrease in slow inhibition can
	cause a transition from interictal to ictal. This is demostrated
	by parametric sweeps of model parameters. The output of the model
	is charecterisied into one of 6 classes, which represent normal,
	rhythmic, spiking and ictal activity. The model is capable of producing
	low amplitude high frequency epileptic discharges, which could not

  abstract = {In human partial epilepsies and in experimental models
	
	of chronic and/or acute epilepsy, the role of inhibition and the
	
	relationship between the inhibition and excitation and epileptogenesis
	
	has long been questioned. Besides experimental methods carried
	
	out either in vitro (human or animal tissue) or in vivo (animals),
	
	pathophysiologic mechanisms can be approached by direct recording
	
	of brain electrical activity in human epilepsy. Indeed, in some
	
	clinical presurgical investigation methods like stereoelectroencephalography,
	
	intracerebral electrodes are used in patients suffering from
	
	drug resistant epilepsy to directly record paroxysmal activities with
	
	excellent temporal resolution (in the order of 1 millisecond). The
	
	study of neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying such depth-EEG
	
	activities is crucial to progress in the understanding of the interictal
	
	to ictal transition. In this study, the authors relate electrophysiologic
	
	patterns typically observed during the transition from interictal
	to
	
	ictal activity in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) to
	
	mechanisms (at a neuronal population level) involved in seizure
	
	generation through a computational model of EEG activity. Intracerebral
	
	EEG signals recorded from hippocampus in five patients
	
	with MTLE during four periods (during interictal activity, just
	
	before seizure onset, during seizure onset, and during ictal activity)
	
	were used to identify the three main parameters of a model of
	
	hippocampus EEG activity (related to excitation, slow dendritic
	
	inhibition and fast somatic inhibition). The identification procedure
	
	used optimization algorithms to minimize a spectral distance between
	
	real and simulated signals. Results demonstrated that the
	
	model generates very realistic signals for automatically identified
	
	parameters. They also showed that the transition from interictal to
	
	ictal activity cannot be simply explained by an increase in excitation
	
	and a decrease in inhibition but rather by time-varying ensemble
	
	interactions between pyramidal cells and local interneurons projecting
	
	to either their dendritic or perisomatic region (with slow and fast
	
	GABAA kinetics). Particularly, during preonset activity, an increasing
	
	dendritic GABAergic inhibition compensates a gradually increasing
	
	excitation up to a brutal drop at seizure onset when faster
	
	oscillations (beta and low gamma band, 15 to 40 Hz) are observed.
	
	These faster oscillations are then explained by the model feedback
	
	loop between pyramidal cells and interneurons targeting their perisomatic
	
	region. These findings obtained from model identification in
	
	human temporal lobe epilepsy are in agreement with some results
	
	obtained experimentally, either on animal models of epilepsy or on
	
	the human epileptic tissue.},
