\section{Discussion}

Models provide insight into neural activity.

Epilepsy is not well understood.

Estimation can provides insight using relevant models with esatimation.

UKF can estimate parameters of a neural mass model under numerous conditions.

Using this estimation method with observations from the hippocampus of human or animal studies will provide insight into the activity occurring in the brain.

This insight may allow for more accurate seizure prediction and detection. 

Insights may allow for better treatments to be developed, by estimating parameter before and after treatment and determining their effect.
